LOGO 1.1 - Intro to video for the Logo website replication
Chris from Codify Academy here.
In this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite coding method, replication,



LOGO 1.2 - Why Replications?
While I was learning recreating what others had done helped me to understand over time how to structure my HTML and CSS so it was easy to change in the future.

I've learned so much over the years by reading others code and recreating it for myself, it helps you truly understand what's happening in the code. I strongly recommend you don't stop trying to use this method of learning when you're coding
